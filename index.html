        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am an undergraduate student at UCR and third-year standing. Iâ€™m also a first-generation student and the second sibling in my family household: my parents, my brothers, and my sister. Iâ€™ve always love to travel one day to Paris, France which I deeply will go for my first destination. When I was in my young age, I never asked myself on what plans or future I would like become for my career path. Sometimes, I usually rationalize of becoming from a celebrity to mathematic teacher, to lawyer, to dance choreographer, to school psychologist, to clinical psychologist, to social worker. My life depends on much opportunity that I have face during from K-12 education school. Therefore, I experienced in a beginner level to advanced level before graduating high school and go to college or university. And now, Iâ€™ve found an institution to where I may be belong to the community at UCR.<br><br>

        As I move up ahead to the game, I encouraged myself to be confident in my career goals to pursue as a clinical psychologist by studying a major in psychology and including in process minor in French. When I began my journey in a four year university at University of California, Riverside (UCR) after transferring from Moreno Valley College (MVC), I felt excited and nervous at the same time to meet up the requirements and offers to recognize. My career goal is to earn my bachelorâ€™s degree in year of 2023 or 2024 (depending on minor required courses) once I apply to a graduate program or school to get my masterâ€™s degree, along moving ahead to another institution, and so far on until I reach to the target. Now, I need to maintain my good standing and GPA as long I can keep up from falling down. If Iâ€™m unable to achieve to my first plan, then Iâ€™ll go pursue for plan B (social worker), plan C (French interpreter), or other careers to be approved based on my qualifications.
<br><br>

        As I talk about my own life and personal goals that Iâ€™ve been thinking about much the memories I have reached my accomplishments. My hobbies that I like to do is dance contemporary, reading theatre and/or poetry books, diamond painting, hangout with my friends and family, shopping to the mall at clothing stores, watch anime tv shows and movies, traveling, and crafting collage prints by using a canvas. The most favorite hobby that Iâ€™ve spend time concentrating on is diamond painting because during covid, I felt isolated from my surroundings of losing much on activities and focused more on my online courses. My first diamond painting was my favorite songwriter, Billie Eilish which I bought a 30cm by 40cm of sticked paper. At first, I was confused on how to attach the diamond beads to the paper by learning off from YouTube video tutorials. Later on, I got used to a brand new technique on how to establish my diamond painting and finishing up as possible before next semester for fall 2020 began. Iâ€™m still continuing on diamond painting with two other paintings that I have saved from my storage in different sizes which became my favorite type of creative art.
